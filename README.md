# Spacy-Text-Summarization
A repository for text summarization using Spacy, a modern natural language processing library.

- Implementations of various text summarization algorithms using Spacy
- Examples of using Spacy for text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Code for evaluating the performance of different summarization algorithms

**Spacy Text Preprocessing**

This repository includes examples of using Spacy for text preprocessing and feature extraction, including:

- Tokenization: breaking down text into individual words or tokens
- Stopword removal: removing common words like "the" and "and" that do not add much value to the text
- Stemming and Lemmatization: reducing words to their base form
- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: identifying the grammatical category of each word
